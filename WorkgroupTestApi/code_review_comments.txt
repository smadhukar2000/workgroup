codereview.cs Review Comments
--------------------

1) General Finding
-----
Code is not compilable, before raising peer review request I think devloper at leaset should check that code is compilable.


2) Item_Not_FoundException class
----------
Class should provide at least one overloaded constructor, so may return some informative message to caller.
e.g. 
public Item_Not_FoundException(string message)
        : base(message)
    {
    }

3) public async Task<T> GetItem(string entity)
  - ln37 var result = null
	 type need to be specified explicitly for null assignments e.g. T result = default(T);
	 
  - ln 24 public List<T> Items { get; }
    As we are exposing get method, set method, so its access type should not be public, it should be protected. 
	
  - Not all code path return value
  - There is no await method
